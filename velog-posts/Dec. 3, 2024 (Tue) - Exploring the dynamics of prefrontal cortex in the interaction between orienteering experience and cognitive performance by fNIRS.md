<li>Summary: The acknowledged plasticity of cognition driven by sports requires comprehensive examination. The impact of orienteering experience on cognitive performance was measured using fNIRS signals. The high-experience expert group exhibited neurological efficiency and demonstrated significantly reduced brain activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal, left ventral lateral prefrontal, and right orbitofrontal regions compared to the low-experience group.</li>
