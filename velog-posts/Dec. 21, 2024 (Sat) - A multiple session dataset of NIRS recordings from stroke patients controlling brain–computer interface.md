<li>Summary: This paper contains an open dataset of NIRS recordings. Fifteen stroke patients performed 237 MI (Motor Imagery) tasks involving imagined hand movements, totaling over 50 hours. Real-time data classification results were presented to provide visual feedback. This dataset is useful for evaluating other BCI frameworks and analysis techniques in patients with cerebrovascular accidents.</li>
