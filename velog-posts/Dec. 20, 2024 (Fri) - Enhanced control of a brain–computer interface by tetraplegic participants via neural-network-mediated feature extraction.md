<li>Summary: To construct a high-quality signal, BCI must extract features that accurately estimate neural activity (i.e., neuronal action potential signal). Feature-engineering techniques to recover functional information have advanced with the advancement of AI, and the quantified goal is a high SNR. A CNN combining feature extraction and decoding can be used to map neural activity. This neural network led to excellent performance both offline and online in a cursor-control task.</li>
