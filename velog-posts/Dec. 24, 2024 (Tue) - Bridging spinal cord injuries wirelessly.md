<li><p>Summary: Spinal cord injuries can disrupt the connection between the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Studies have shown that PNS activation can be restored using preprogrammed sequences corresponding to standing or walking. This brain-spine interface (BSI) enables users to adaptively and naturally control the timing and amplitude of stimulated muscle activity. The BSI consists of two cortical implants with 64 electrodes and peripheral electronics that measure electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals from the sensorimotor cortex. Wireless signals are transmitted via an antenna to an implantable pulse generator, which delivers epidural electrical stimulation to the spinal cord to activate limb muscles.</p>
