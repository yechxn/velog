<li>Summary: Robotic ultrasound (RUS) offers a viable solution to address its limitations; nonetheless, achieving human-level proficiency remains challenging. Imitation learning or learning-from-demonstrations (LfD) methods have been explored in RUS, which learns a policy prior from offline demonstrations to encode the mental model of expert sonographers. This paper suggests a coaching framework (i.e., active feedback) for RUS to amplify its performance. This novel framework combines DRL (self-supervised practice employing an off-policy Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) network) with sparse expert feedback through coaching. The coaching by experts is modeled as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP).</li>
