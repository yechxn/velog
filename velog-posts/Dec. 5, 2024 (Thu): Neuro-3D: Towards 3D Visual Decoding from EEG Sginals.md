<li>Summary: To understand how the brain perceives and processes 3D visual stimuli in the real world, this paper introduced a new neuroscience task: decoding 3D visual perception from EEG signals, a neuroimaging technique that enables real-time monitoring of neural dynamics enriched with complex visual cues. The researchers developed the following models:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>EEG-3D</strong>: An open-source multimodal EEG dataset from 12 subjects who viewed 72 categories of 3D objects, including both videos and images.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>

<li><strong>Neuro-3D</strong>: A diffusion-based colored point cloud decoderâ€”a 3D visual decoding framework based on EEG signals that recovers both the shape and color of 3D objects.</li>
</ol>
