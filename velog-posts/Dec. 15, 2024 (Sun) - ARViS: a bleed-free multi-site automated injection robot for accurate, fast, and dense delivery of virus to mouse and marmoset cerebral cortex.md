<li>Summary: If genetically encoded fluorescent sensors were expressed across multiple cortical areas in non-human primates, it would be possible to measure a variety of spatiotemporal dynamics of primate-specific cortical activity. The ARViS (Automated Robotic Virus injection System) is developed for broad expression of a biosensor. There are two key technologies:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Image recognition of vasculature structures to determine multiple injection sites.</li>
<li>Robotic control of micropipette insertion perpendicular to the cortical surface with 50 Î¼m precision.</li>
</ol>
