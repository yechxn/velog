<li><p>Summary: Intravenous Access (IVA) is the most common invasive medical procedure. Globally, it is estimated that over one billion IVA devices (needles and catheters) are used annually. However, the overall failure rate in this procedure is unacceptably high (35â€“50%). IVA methods include vein imaging, localization, needle insertion, venipuncture detection, catheter placement, and complete robotic IVA platforms. Clinical IVA procedures involve the following steps:</p>

<p>(i) Vein Perception and Localization
(ii) Venipuncture Detection
(iii) Needle Insertion / Retraction Control</p>
