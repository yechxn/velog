<li>Summary: The BCI-actuated supernumerary robotic finger (BCI-SRF) for brain-machine interaction is a research field focused on studying the brain's neuroplasticity mechanisms during motor learning tasks. After training, the BCI-SRF group showed a 350% improvement in sequence opposition accuracy compared to the Finger group before and after training. The BCI-SRF group had increased functional connectivity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the sensorimotor regions, including both intra- and inter-hemispheric networks. In conclusion, the BCI-SRF task enhances motor sequence learning ability by reorganizing functional networks in the sensorimotor regions.</li>
