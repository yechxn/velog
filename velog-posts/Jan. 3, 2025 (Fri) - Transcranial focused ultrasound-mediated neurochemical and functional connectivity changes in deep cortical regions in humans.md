<li>Summary: Low-intensity transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is an emerging non-invasive technique for focally neuromodulating brain function. Neurochemical mechanisms underlying TUS remain under investigation. Theta-burst TUS, a protocol shown to increase corticospinal excitability, reduced GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) levels in two regions: the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Furthermore, functional connectivity in both regions increased following TUS.</li>
